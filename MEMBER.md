Mara Ma’s main duty was to determine the theme of our project. After deciding on the theme, we focused on designing the database schema and creating the E/R diagram. Once these tasks were completed, Mara finished the related part of the report.

Franda Zhu’s main duty was the frontend, including UI design and making fetch calls to the backend. Additionally, Franda completed most of the report's content. Currently, the basic UI design is done.

Rebecca Zhao focused on the backend, including the implementation of the Flask framework and SQL queries. Rebecca Zhao and Mara Ma also provided a README file explaining how to run the backend service.

Mara Ma will keep focusing on the report. Besides, Mara Ma will cooperate with Rebecca Zhao on further backend implementations (two more features on Brands). Franda Zhu will be responsible for the corresponding frontend implementations like search bar. Currently, we have finished all Six features for the brands section.
